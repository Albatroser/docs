# Contributing to Instabot

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

## Adding the new language

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot).
2. Create a folder with the name of your country in the abbreviation.
3. Copy all the files from the `/en/` folder to your earlier created folder.
4. Translate the files into your language, leaving the file structure of the previous one (paragraphs etc).
5. Add the link to your docs in the main [README.md](README.md) file. Don't forget to add the flag emoji!
6. Create pull request.

## Adding the new docs
If you want to add a new documentation page in any language please follow the guide below.

1. If your docs have not been written in english, please translate your doc in English too and add it into [en/](en/) folder.
2. Make sure that your doc is written descriptive enough. If you use pictures, please upload them into [img/](img/) folder.
3. Add the link to your doc into the existing docs to make other users find your page.
4. Create pull request with your docs.
